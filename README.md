# [Project 1 :  Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/DanielWeller/-Fashion-MNIST-/blob/master/Fashion_MNIST.ipynb)
* `Fashion-MNIST` is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000   examples. 
* Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. We intend `Fashion-MNIST` to serve as a direct drop-in 
* replacement for the original [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms. It shares the same image size and structure of  training and testing splits.
